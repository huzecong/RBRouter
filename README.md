# RBRouter
Implementation of Rubber-band Based Router for OOP team project.

Based on the original paper from [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.8.6828](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.8.6828), also attached in the paper folder.

This project concerns only the parts described in the paper, that is, the local routing part, excluding layer assignment and net decomposition. We are currently aiming for the `$O(n^2\log n)$` algorithm for sequential net embedding, and will try to tackle the `$O(n\log n)$` algorithm if we have time.
